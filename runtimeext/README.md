Functions that maybe should be part of the standard go runtime.

Contains a function `Must` that calls `log.Fatal` if its first argument is not a
nil error and prints out a nice error message otherwise.  Using `Must` aids in
the pursuit of 100% code coverage, because it means that the error pathway of
`log.Fatal` is in this library instead of inline with the code being tested.
