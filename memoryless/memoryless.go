// Run calls the given function repeatedly, waiting a c.Expected amount of time
// between calls on average. The wait time is actually random and will generate
// a memoryless (Poisson) distribution of f() calls in time, ensuring that f()
// has the PASTA property (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages). This statistical
// guarantee is subject to two caveats.
//
// Caveat 1 is that, in a nod to the realities of systems needing to have
// guarantees, we allow the random wait time to be clamped both above and below.
// This means that calls to f() should be at least c.Min and at most c.Max apart
// in time. This clamping causes bias in the timing. For use of this function to
// be statistically sensible, the clamping should not be too extreme. The exact
// mathematical meaning of "too extreme" depends on your situation, but a nice
// rule of thumb is c.Min should be at most 10% of expected and c.Max should be
// at least 250% of expected. These values mean that less than 10% of time you
// will be waiting c.Min and less than 10% of the time you will be waiting
// c.Max.
//
// Caveat 2 is that this assumes that the function f() takes negligible time to
// run when compared to the expected wait time. Technically memoryless events
// have the property that the times between successive event starts has the
// exponential distribution, and this code will not start a new call to f()
// before the old one has completed, which provides a lower bound on wait times.
